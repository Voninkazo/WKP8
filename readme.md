1. In a few sentences, explain the structure of your project.

    Generally, I have a few functions. The first function is creating a new object of a new song, then I generated the new object in an html which is stored in another function. To save and updated item in the local storage, I have two functions which shwoing all items(songs) in the application(LS) and update the lists after deeting any items. And I worked out how to increase the score when clicking the button plus whcih is generated in another function by using dispatch event.
    Then I have a handle click to set conditions of when clicing the increament button and the delete icon. And the last two three functions generate the filtered songs by style, title and handling the reset button to get all of the songs back. 
2. If you had more time, what area of your project would you improve?

    If I had more time, I would work set some information to say that a song is not found when there is no song matches in the entered inputs. Then I would improve my css style to make it more beautiful :)

3. Did you learn anything new while working on this project?

    In this project, I learned more about filtering and sorting which is great.

4. What was the most challenging part for you?

    Personally, I found it was hard to get the increment button worked.
    
5. Would you like a new explanation about a specific topic?
